lex_rules.txt
=============

``lex_rules.txt`` is an optional file. It contains rules that assign additional attributes to certain combinations of lemmata and tags after the analysis is complete. One way of using it is assigning "secondary lemmata" and separate translations to lexicalized combinations of stems and productive derivational affixes.
